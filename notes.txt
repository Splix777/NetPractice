TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol:
- Is a set of networking protocols that form the basis for communication on the internet
  and many local area networks (LANs). It provides a standardized way for different devices
  and systems to communicate and exchange data over networks.

IP Addresses:

- An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numeric identifier assigned to each device
  on a network. It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other.
- IP addresses come in two main versions: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6
  (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 addresses are the most common and are expressed as
  four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

Subnet Masks:

- A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that divides an IP address into network and host portions.
  It helps routers and devices determine whether another device is on the same local network
  or on a different network.
- Subnet masks are typically expressed using dotted decimal notation, like an IP address.
  For example, a common subnet mask for a local network might be 255.255.255.0.

Local IP Addresses:

- Local IP addresses are used within a private network, like a home or business LAN, to
  identify devices within that network. These addresses are not globally unique and cannot
  be used on the public internet.
- Common ranges of local IP addresses are 192.168.x.x, 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x, and 10.x.x.x.
  These ranges are reserved for private networks.

Internet IP Addresses:

- Internet IP addresses, also known as public IP addresses, are globally unique and used to
  identify devices on the public internet. These addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers
  (ISPs) and are used to route traffic across the internet.
- IPv4 public addresses are becoming scarce due to the rapid growth of the internet. IPv6 was
  introduced to address this issue and provides a much larger pool of unique addresses.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):

- TCP is one of the main protocols in the TCP/IP suite. It provides reliable, connection-oriented
  communication between devices. TCP ensures that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors.
- It is widely used for applications that require data integrity, such as web browsing, email,
  and file transfer.

IP (Internet Protocol):

- IP is another core protocol in the TCP/IP suite. It is responsible for addressing and routing
  packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination.
- IPv4 and IPv6 are different versions of the IP protocol, with IPv6 designed to address the
  limitations of IPv4 and support the growing number of internet-connected devices.

In summary, TCP/IP is a suite of protocols that enable communication and data exchange on networks,
both local and global. IP addresses, subnet masks, local IP addresses, and internet IP addresses are
essential components of the TCP/IP architecture, helping devices identify and route data to its
intended destination while maintaining data integrity and security.

==================================================

Decimal Notation in subnet masks:

In decimal notation, a subnet mask consists of four octets (each octet is 8 bits), and each
octet is represented in decimal form. The subnet mask is used to specify the network portion
of an IP address. The most common subnet masks are 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0, and 255.255.255.0.

Here are some examples:

/8 Subnet Mask (255.0.0.0):

In binary, this is 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000.
This subnet mask means the first 8 bits of the IP address are the network portion, and the
remaining 24 bits are for host addresses.
Example IP: 192.0.2.1
Network: 192.0.0.0 (the first 8 bits are the network identifier)
/16 Subnet Mask (255.255.0.0):

In binary, this is 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000.
This subnet mask means the first 16 bits of the IP address are the network portion, and the
remaining 16 bits are for host addresses.
Example IP: 192.168.1.1
Network: 192.168.0.0 (the first 16 bits are the network identifier)
/24 Subnet Mask (255.255.255.0):

In binary, this is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000.
This subnet mask means the first 24 bits of the IP address are the network portion, and the
remaining 8 bits are for host addresses.
Example IP: 192.168.1.1
Network: 192.168.1.0 (the first 24 bits are the network identifier)

Hexadecimal Notation:
In hexadecimal notation, subnet masks are represented as a string of eight characters, each
character being a hexadecimal digit. Each pair of characters corresponds to an octet in the subnet mask.

Here are some examples:

/30 Subnet Mask (Hexadecimal: FFFFFFFC):

In binary, this is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100.
This subnet mask means the first 30 bits of the IP address are the network portion, and the
remaining 2 bits are for host addresses.
Example IP range: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.3 (4 possible addresses)
Explanation: The last 2 bits can represent 4 different values (00, 01, 10, 11), so there are
4 possible host addresses.
/25 Subnet Mask (Hexadecimal: FFFFFF80):

In binary, this is 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000.
This subnet mask means the first 25 bits of the IP address are the network portion, and the
remaining 7 bits are for host addresses.
Example IP range: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.127 (128 possible addresses)
Explanation: The last 7 bits can represent 128 different values, so there are 128 possible host addresses.

Hexadecimal notation is often used in networking because it's more concise and can represent
8 bits (1 byte) in just two characters, making it easier to work with and calculate subnet masks.
It's important to understand both decimal and hexadecimal notations, as they are used
interchangeably in different networking contexts.
